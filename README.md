# HelloWhirled

Since I had to create a "hello world" repository as part of the initial tutorial, I decided to continue and provide its pitiful existence some sort of purpose.

Here you will find various kinds of "Hello, Whirled!" programs. (This is a close relative of the more advanced "Visualize Whirled Peas!" application.)

The excitement is overwhelming.

ATARI_BASIC -- Ye old, standard Atari BASIC.

ATARI_BASICXL -- OSS BASIC XL on Atari.  Note the pretty, mixed-case keywords.

ATARI_BASICXL_BIGTEXT -- OSS BASIC XL on Atari.  Small change to engage the large text mode for display.

ATARI_ATASM_DIRECTWRITE -- 6502 Assembly for atasm.  Uses the OS Page 0 Pointer to the screen to write directly to screen memory.

ATARI_ATASM_CIO_PUTBYTES -- 6502 Assembly for atasm.  Uses the OS Central I/O to write a scring to the screen (E: device.)
